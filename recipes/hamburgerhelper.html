    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul class="Ingredients">
      <li>
        <strong>Ground beef</strong> - I like to use extra lean ground beef, at
        least 90%. 1 Pound extra lean ground beef.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Onion</strong> - Vidalia (sweet) onions. 1/2 medium onion
        chopped
      </li>
      <li>
        <stong>Tomato paste</stong> - It's an easy, economical way to get
        concentrated tomato flavor. 2 tablespoons tomato paste.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garlic powder and chili powder</strong> - Simple seasoning blend
        to infuse savory flavors. 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon of
        chili powder.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>ELbow macaroni</strong> - the class pasta shape or you can be
        spicy and do shelled. 1 cup uncooked elbow macaroni.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef broth</strong> - For a deeper, richer flavor to the sauce.
        3 cups beef broth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sharp cheddar cheese</strong> - Cheese Just make the dish creamy
        enough if not add more cheese! 2 cups freshly grated cheddar cheese.
      </li>
      <li>Salt & pepper to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="header2">Steps</h3>
    <ul class="Instructions">
      <li>
        Add the beef and onions to a soup pot. Cook over medium-high heat until
        the beef has browned (about 7-10 minutes), breaking the meat up with
        your spoon as you go along. If there's a lot of excess fat, spoon most
        of it out.
      </li>
      <li>Stir in the tomato paste, garlic powder, and chili powder.</li>
      <li>
        Add in the beef broth and increase the heat to high. Once it starts
        boiling, add in the macaroni.
      </li>
      <li>
        Reduce the heat so it's not furiously boiling (a rapid simmer is good).
        I ended up cooking mine over medium heat. Let it cook uncovered until
        the pasta is tender and most of the liquid has been absorbed (about
        13-15 minutes). I stir it every couple of minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While it's cooking, grate the cheese (this saves prep time at the start
        of the recipe).
      </li>
      <li>
        Take the pot off the heat and stir in the cheese. Season with salt &
        pepper as needed. I let it sit for a couple minutes prior to serving
        (soaks up the sauce and flavors more), but you can serve it right away.
      </li>
    </ul>
